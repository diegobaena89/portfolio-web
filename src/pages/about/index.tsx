          Hello! I'm Diego, a technology enthusiast based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
          My academic journey covers a wide range of fields. I have a background
          in Music, Literature, Analysis, and System Development. Additionally,
          I hold a master's degree in Modern Greek Language and Literature,
          allowing me to delve into language and culture roots.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, I'm a passionate frontend developer. For me, software
          development is not just a profession; it's a way to merge creativity
          with technical skills. I collaborate with teams to craft engaging,
          functional interfaces connecting people to the digital world. My
          commitment to continuous learning and multidisciplinary approach
          provide a unique perspective when tackling software development
          challenges.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm excited to share my experiences and projects with you. Let's
          explore the realms of technology and creativity together.
